The warehouse layer is a part of the data warehouse where the actual storage,
management, and querying of data occur.
It serves as the core repository for data that has been collected,
transformed, and integrated from various sources.

In dbt (data build tool), the concepts of "upstream" and "downstream" are used to describe 
the relationship between models (SQL files) in your data pipeline. Hereâ€™s what they mean:

Upstream

Definition:
"Upstream" refers to the models or tables that provide input data to other models. 
These are the sources or earlier steps in your data pipeline.

Example: If you have a model base_customers that aggregates raw customer data and another 
model customer_summary that builds on base_customers, then base_customers is considered upstream of customer_summary.

Function:
Upstream models are typically responsible for preparing or transforming raw data, 
making it available for downstream models to use.

---------

Downstream:

Definition:
"Downstream" refers to the models or tables that depend on other models for their input.
These are the targets or later steps in your data pipeline.

Example:
In the scenario above, the customer_summary model is downstream of the base_customers model.
It relies on the output of base_customers to perform further transformations or aggregations.

Function:
Downstream models are built on top of the data processed by upstream models.
They use the cleaned and transformed data from upstream models to produce final results or more refined outputs.
