--PROJECT--

Purpose:

The project aims to implement the modern data stack to solve a real-life problem.

In addition to using a certain number of techniques, there is a focus on working together in a computer team. This
means both agile development and being able to use git and github in a team.

Background:
The company Arbetskollen AB wants to build a data pipeline that serves a dashboard to visualize statistics
for job advertisements.

The work team has had a data engineer (DE) who together with the product owner (PO) made an initial
dimensional modeling that is not complete. THEY would really like to finish
the dimensional modelling, but the company's CEO quickly wanted to see a prototype in order to apply for investment.
